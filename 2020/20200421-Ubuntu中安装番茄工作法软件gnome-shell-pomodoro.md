#   作用
>   This GNOME app helps to manage time according to Pomodoro Technique. It intends to improve productivity and quality of work by reminding you to take short breaks.
>   Pomodoro Technique is based on two principles:
>   +   focusing on work for limited time, about half an hour,
>   +   clearing your mind during breaks.
>   This workflow can improve focus, physical health and mental agility depending on how you spend your breaks and how strictly you follow the routine.
